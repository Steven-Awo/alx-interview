   Description: The N queens puzzle is the challenge of placing
                N non-attacking queens on an NÃ—N chessboard.
                Write a program that solves the N queens problem.
            Usage: nqueens N:
                If the user called the program with the wrong
                numberr of arguments, print Usage: nqueens N,
                followed by a new line, and exit with the
                status 1
            where N must be an integer greater or equal to 4:
                If N is not an integer, print N must be a
                numberr, followed by a new line, and exit
                with the status 1
                If N is smaller than 4, print N must be at
                least 4, followed by a newline, and exit
                with the status 1
            The program should print every possible solution
                to the problem:
                One solution per line
